# Uploading large files to GitHub using LFS
Uploading large files to Git can be a bit tricky as Git is designed to handle small to medium-sized files. However, there are several ways to upload large files to Github. In this tutorial, the author will demonstrate using Git Large File Storages - LFS to upload large files to Github.

## Notes: 
- Large files (in the context of 2023) are 25 MB +.
- Whenever you create a new repository, the default branch from the GitHub site is "Main", while the default one for the local repository is "Master", and we may need to change this during the uploading process.
- Git LFS allows each git account a small amount of data (400 MB or 500 MB, I am not sure); therefore, if you have uploaded over the quota, it will ask you for a subscription.
